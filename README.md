Welcome to Bash Facilities
==========================

This repos is forked from [wesleyit/bash_facilities](https://github.com/wesleyit/bash_facilities) that I liked but I take some things off and create something usefull to me.

Idea
----------
Give you a better management of your bash config and 
init files. 

Bash is your friend, go ahead and make it your way!

Requisites
----------
I created a repository to config my machine called [pedrocesar-ti/machine](), and there I guarantee the installation of all tools needed, even if you are in a MacOSX or a Debian bassed Linux. 

The requirements are:
* curl
* git
* bash-completion
* rbenv
* nodeenv

Install
-------

To install, open your terminal (using bash, it will not work on zsh or oh-my-zsh).
Type:

Then, exit the terminal and open it again. It is done!
